# Portfolio For An Amazing Artist And A Photographer

### The status of this project is IN PROGRESS. All the text and images (with the exceprion of photos) are placeholders. Both design and development are done by Natalie Sokolova

## Built with modern React.js, using hooks and react-router on the frontend, and Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL on the backend.

## In addition, it uses emailjs to send emails, react-toastify to show styled notifications (for instance, when a visitor successfully sends an email, or attempts to save a copyrighted image), and simple-react-lightbox to show image carousel.
